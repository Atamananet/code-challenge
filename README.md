## Things that I would like to implement but did not have enough time:

### Task 1:
- [ ] cover more code with tests
- [ ] load data from API and render HTML on the server side, not on the client
- [ ] split the code into separated, more structured modules

### Task 2:
- [ ] rewrite HTML using BEM methodology and then organize styles (in BEM and with var() feature)
- [ ] change the colors of the form to more contrasting ones
protect form fields from overflow

... etc
